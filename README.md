## Quickstart example

This is an HTTP server which responds with `Hello World` to every request.

```php
$loop = React\EventLoop\Factory::create();
$socket = new React\Socket\Server(8080, $loop);

$http = new React\Http\Server($socket);
$http->on('request', function (Request $request, Response $response) {
    $response->writeHead(200, array('Content-Type' => 'text/plain'));
    $response->end("Hello World!\n");
});

$loop->run();
```

See also the [examples](examples).

## Usage

### Server

The `Server` class is responsible for handling incoming connections and then
emit a `request` event for each incoming HTTP request.

It attaches itself to an instance of `React\Socket\ServerInterface` which
emits underlying streaming connections in order to then parse incoming data
as HTTP:

```php
$socket = new React\Socket\Server(8080, $loop);

$http = new React\Http\Server($socket);
```

Similarly, you can also attach this to a
[`React\Socket\SecureServer`](https://github.com/reactphp/socket#secureserver)
in order to start a secure HTTPS server like this:

```php
$socket = new Server(8080, $loop);
$socket = new SecureServer($socket, $loop, array(
    'local_cert' => __DIR__ . '/localhost.pem'
));

$http = new React\Http\Server($socket);
```

For each incoming connection, it emits a `request` event with the respective
[`Request`](#request) and [`Response`](#response) objects:

```php
$http->on('request', function (Request $request, Response $response) {
    $response->writeHead(200, array('Content-Type' => 'text/plain'));
    $response->end("Hello World!\n");
});
```

See also [`Request`](#request) and [`Response`](#response) for more details.

> Note that you SHOULD always listen for the `request` event.
Failing to do so will result in the server parsing the incoming request,
but never sending a response back to the client.

Checkout [Request](#request) for details about the request data body.

The `Server` supports both HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/1.0 request messages.
If a client sends an invalid request message, uses an invalid HTTP protocol
version or sends an invalid `Transfer-Encoding` in the request header, it will
emit an `error` event, send an HTTP error response to the client and close the connection:

```php
$http->on('error', function (Exception $e) {
    echo 'Error: ' . $e->getMessage() . PHP_EOL;
});
```

The request object can also emit an error. Checkout [Request](#request) for more details.

### Request

The `Request` class is responsible for streaming the incoming request body
and contains meta data which was parsed from the request headers.
If the request body is chunked-encoded, the data will be decoded and emitted on the data event.
The `Transfer-Encoding` header will be removed.

It implements the `ReadableStreamInterface`.

Listen on the `data` event and the `end` event of the [Request](#request)
to evaluate the data of the request body:

```php
$http->on('request', function (Request $request, Response $response) {
    $contentLength = 0;
    $request->on('data', function ($data) use (&$contentLength) {
        $contentLength += strlen($data);
    });

    $request->on('end', function () use ($response, &$contentLength){
        $response->writeHead(200, array('Content-Type' => 'text/plain'));
        $response->end("The length of the submitted request body is: " . $contentLength);
    });

    // an error occures e.g. on invalid chunked encoded data or an unexpected 'end' event 
    $request->on('error', function (\Exception $exception) use ($response, &$contentLength) {
        $response->writeHead(400, array('Content-Type' => 'text/plain'));
        $response->end("An error occured while reading at length: " . $contentLength);
    });
});
```

An error will just `pause` the connection instead of closing it. A response message
can still be sent.

A `close` event will be emitted after an `error` or `end` event.

The constructor is internal, you SHOULD NOT call this yourself.
The `Server` is responsible for emitting `Request` and `Response` objects.

See the above usage example and the class outline for details.

#### getMethod()

The `getMethod(): string` method can be used to
return the request method.

#### getPath()

The `getPath(): string` method can be used to
return the request path.

#### getQueryParams()

The `getQueryParams(): array` method can be used to
return an array with all query parameters ($_GET).

#### getProtocolVersion()

The `getProtocolVersion(): string` method can be used to
return the HTTP protocol version (such as "1.0" or "1.1").

#### getHeaders()

The `getHeaders(): array` method can be used to
return an array with ALL headers.

The keys represent the header name in the exact case in which they were
originally specified. The values will be an array of strings for each
value for the respective header name.

#### getHeader()

The `getHeader(string $name): string[]` method can be used to
retrieve a message header value by the given case-insensitive name.

Returns a list of all values for this header name or an empty array if header was not found

#### getHeaderLine()

The `getHeaderLine(string $name): string` method can be used to
retrieve a comma-separated string of the values for a single header.

Returns a comma-separated list of all values for this header name or an empty string if header was not found

#### hasHeader()

The `hasHeader(string $name): bool` method can be used to
check if a header exists by the given case-insensitive name.

### Response

The `Response` class is responsible for streaming the outgoing response body.

It implements the `WritableStreamInterface`.

The constructor is internal, you SHOULD NOT call this yourself.
The `Server` is responsible for emitting `Request` and `Response` objects.

The `Response` will automatically use the same HTTP protocol version as the
corresponding `Request`.

HTTP/1.1 responses will automatically apply chunked transfer encoding if
no `Content-Length` header has been set.
See [`writeHead()`](#writehead) for more details.

See the above usage example and the class outline for details.

#### writeHead()

The `writeHead(int $status = 200, array $headers = array(): void` method can be used to
write the given HTTP message header.

This method MUST be invoked once before calling `write()` or `end()` to send
the actual HTTP message body:

```php
$response->writeHead(200, array(
    'Content-Type' => 'text/plain'
));
$response->end('Hello World!');
```

Calling this method more than once will result in an `Exception`
(unless the response has ended/closed already).
Calling this method after the response has ended/closed is a NOOP.

Unless you specify a `Content-Length` header yourself, HTTP/1.1 responses
will automatically use chunked transfer encoding and send the respective header
(`Transfer-Encoding: chunked`) automatically. The server is responsible for handling
`Transfer-Encoding` so you SHOULD NOT pass it yourself.
If you know the length of your body, you MAY specify it like this instead:

```php
$data = 'Hello World!';

$response->writeHead(200, array(
    'Content-Type' => 'text/plain',
    'Content-Length' => strlen($data)
));
$response->end($data);
```

A `Date` header will be automatically added with the system date and time if none is given.
You can add a custom `Date` header yourself like this:

```php
$response->writeHead(200, array(
    'Date' => date('D, d M Y H:i:s T')
));
```

If you don't have a appropriate clock to rely on, you should
unset this header with an empty array:

```php
$response->writeHead(200, array(
    'Date' => array()
));
```

Note that it will automatically assume a `X-Powered-By: react/alpha` header
unless your specify a custom `X-Powered-By` header yourself:

```php
$response->writeHead(200, array(
    'X-Powered-By' => 'PHP 3'
));
```

If you do not want to send this header at all, you can use an empty array as
value like this:

```php
$response->writeHead(200, array(
    'X-Powered-By' => array()
));
```

Note that persistent connections (`Connection: keep-alive`) are currently
not supported.
As such, HTTP/1.1 response messages will automatically include a
`Connection: close` header, irrespective of what header values are
passed explicitly.
